# Analysis for A. Gigas lncRNA paper

- [x] Find ncRNAs;
- [x] Predict lncRNA functions by coexpression;
- [X] Run homology search against RNACentral and close genomes;
- [x] Housekeeping classification;
- [x] Script for DE analysis (change criteria to presented in the paper);
- [X] Simplify table 3 (Summary of ncRNA annotations), and include percent with homologs from table 5;
- [X] Simplify table 4 (Sequences similar to A. gigas ncRNAs);
- [X] Replace table 5 counts with percentages of predictions similar to other species. This can also be included in table 3, removing the need for a table 5;
- [X] Re-generate all supplementary files;
- [X] Re-write functional prediction metodology;
- [X] Do tissue expression analysis ONLY for lncrna (do not include short rnas)
